    "# Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "Minecraft is a video game in which players can explore a virtual 3D world. It has become a sensation worldwide and rakes in millions of players every year. At UBC, a research group in the computer science department have set up a Minecraft server to develop AI that can act in a virtual environment. Random participants were recruited to play the game, and their in-game actions were recorded. The logistics of this project are not simple so our goal is to analyze the data with R programming to help streamline their operations. The research team is specifically interested in targeting their recruitment efforts and ensuring they have sufficient resources to support the server. We aim to draw inferences/patterns from the data to determine the target audience or the times when most players are online. In this proposal, we will focus on predicting whether a player will subscribe to the game newsletter. Through data analysis and predictive modeling, we hope to help the team target the right audience for future recruitment efforts.\n",
    "\n",
    "The overarching question being addressed is: “What player characteristics and behaviours are most predictive of subscribing to a game-related newsletter, and how do these features differ between various player types?”, from this we formulated our research question: Can the number of played hours and the age of the players be used to predict a player's subscription status? We hypothesize that the longer time playing and the more minor the age, the more chance of subscribing. We will first load the R package (tidyverse and tidymodels)."

Also, there are overlapping areas from the third graph which may distract the predictions' accuracy. Last, this data set isn't big enough to contain players with longer playing time while not subscribing (which may be possible for new observations).

    "From our analysis above, we found that most players who are subscribed to a game-related newsletter, had a total playtime of over 0 hours, whereas most players who are not subscribed to a game-related newsletter had a playtime of 0 hours. We also found that the average subscribed players’ age range goes from 10-28 years old, and the unsubscribed players’ age range goes from 17-33, which shows that younger players show more interest in games. Through the scatterplot visual that we made, it was found that all the players who had a total playtime of 10 or more hours were subscribed to a game newsletter, and also that for those below the age of 30, a majority of the players are subscribed compared to not. This shows that if they want to get more data from these players, the researchers at UBC should be trying to target the players who are subscribed to a game-related newsletter, and a majority of the players who are subscribed are in the younger age range. We also found that the number of played hours and the age of players can, in fact, be used to predict a player’s subscription status.\n"

So, we can conduct survey for this group of player for better prediction.
